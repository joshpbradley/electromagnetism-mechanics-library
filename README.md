# Electromagnetism Mechanics Library (EML)
Project completed in 2022, during year 4 of my MSci Computer Science degree, completed at Lancaster University.

The EML can be imported into Unity applications to simulate the deflection of charged particles in the presence of a non-linear magnetic field. Specifically, this library simulates the deflection of charged particles due to the Lorentz force, around magnetic dipoles.

For more information on this project, please read the accompanying dissertation, which covers the project motivation, design, implementation and testing.

An example of this software being used is in my Particle Pinball Machine project. The EML is responsible for the curved deflection of the small white particles surrounding the Earth.
